# We are going to inform the assistant that the user has a schedule and prompt it to help the user.
# In this part you can customize:
# - The user's name: what the assistant will call the user.
# - The schedule: the user's schedule that the assistant will use to provide help.
# - The prompt: the message that the assistant will receive when the conversation starts to understand the context of the conversation.
# - The first message: the first message the assistant will say to the user.

# Prompts are used to provide context to the assistant and help it understand the user's needs.

# Here's my example:
user_name = "Alex"
schedule = "Sales Meeting with Taipy at 10:00; Gym with Sophie at 17:00"
prompt = f"You are a helpful assistant. Your interlocutor has the following schedule: {schedule}. Help them manage their time and tasks effectively."
